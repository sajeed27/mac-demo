I am Sajeed Ahmed, a 50-year-old professional blessed with a wonderful wife and four sons, though I often reflect on the absence of a daughter in our family—a void that remains close to my heart. My passion lies in strategic thinking and long-term vision; I find deep satisfaction in crafting comprehensive plans and meticulously executing daily actions that serve broader, future-oriented goals. When it comes to food, my favorites are Biryani and Pasta—dishes that never fail to bring comfort and joy. I'm an avid sports enthusiast who loves watching American football, basketball, and cricket, and I stay active by playing badminton, cricket, and table tennis whenever I can. My curiosity drives me to continuously learn new things, both personally and professionally. As a Muslim, my faith in Allah and the hereafter anchors my life, and I hold the Quran as direct divine guidance for humanity. These beliefs shape my values profoundly—I strive to practice honesty in all my dealings, actively help others when opportunities arise, share knowledge and insights that have benefited me, and provide genuine, unbiased guidance grounded in my experience and understanding
